## Full-Stack Software Engineer Qualification Challenge

### About the role and company

At Exponential Ventures, we’re continually creating new products and businesses, and as a Full-Stack Software Engineer, 
you’d be responsible for implementing all aspects of the product, following all of the industry’s best practices 
while quickly delivering a performant and scalable product that you’ll be proud of.

We’d like to see how you can handle yourself implementing from scratch the frontend and backend of a simple application 
based on our description of the vision and the stated requirements. We’d like to see your submission implemented using 
Python for the backend, and React for the frontend.

Your submission will be evaluated as a whole, but we won’t fret if your design isn’t made by unicorns. We’ll be focusing
 on the correct implementation of the vision, the quality of the code, the application of best practices, and the 
 product’s overall experience.


This project is only going to be used to evaluate your skill set, and it will never be shared or used commercially.


### The idea - A Quiz App

Nowadays, it has become popular amongst internet users to spend some of their time testing their general 
knowledge through quizzes (and brag about it when they ace it). The idea is to design the prototype for a 
quiz app that is pleasant, engaging, and easy to use. In the end, we’ll inform the user about his performance 
and translate those results into a grade.


#### Requirements


Each question has only four possible answers, of which only one is correct.

On top of showing the grade, show statistics on how the user’s answers compared to the other users that 
answered these questions before

On the results page, show a range of different expertise levels for each grade bracket with a short description
 for each expertise level. E.g.

* Score 0-2: Clueless. Don’t be discouraged! Learn some more about this topic, and come back to try again!

* Score 3-5: Beginner. This is the level most players end up with after answering this quiz for the first time.
 Learn some more about this topic and come back to try again!

* Score 5-8: Confident: This is the level players are getting pro! Continue your progress and rock it!

* Score 8-10: Expert: This is the highest level achievable! Thanks for being awesome as you are!

Show the time it took to answer the quiz.



We encourage you to work with your creativity, implementing features and quizzes that you would like to see 
and answer

Create an authentication method, and only allow users who were already registered in the database, 
so you will not need to create a signup page.


#### Bonus Features


Allow the user to share the result of his quiz on social media.

Allow multiple quizzes to be administered through the same app.

Record the user’s performance from previous attempts and compare performance improvement over time.

Sign up page for new users.

Testing coverage - Testing is highly encouraged as a bonus feature


### What do we expect?


Use some Python 3.X compatible web framework

We highly recommend that you create your project using Docker. This will make our evaluation easier and will 
guarantee that your assessment won't fail due to differences between the development and test environments. 
Any project that takes an inordinate amount of effort to run may be discarded as part of the work of a 
Fullstack Engineer is to make sure that the project can run in their intended environments

Documentation explaining how to run and use the application on a README.md file Git repository of the challenge.

Finish your project before sending it; we won't accept modifications after submission.

If you have any questions or doubts about this challenge, send an email to recruiting@xnv.io.

This prototype and wireframes will not be used commercially and will be discarded after evaluation.
